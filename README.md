# WeatherCast - Cross-Platform Weather App with Capacitor

A modern weather application built with **Capacitor** that runs natively on iOS, Android, and the web from a single codebase. This project demonstrates how Capacitor enables seamless cross-platform development while providing access to native device features like geolocation.

## 🚀 Capacitor: The Cross-Platform Engine

**Capacitor** is the core technology that powers this application's cross-platform capabilities. It allows us to:

## 🔄 From Web to Native: The Capacitor Integration

This weather application started as a standard React web application and was transformed into a cross-platform native app by integrating **Capacitor**. Here's how the transformation happened:

### Original React Web App
The project began as a typical React application with:
- Vite as the build tool
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Standard web APIs for geolocation
- Fetch API for weather data

### Adding Capacitor Integration

**Step 1: Install Capacitor**
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
```

**Step 2: Initialize Capacitor**
```bash
npx cap init "WeatherCast" "com.example.app"
```
This created the `capacitor.config.ts` file with app configuration.

**Step 3: Add Platform Support**
```bash
# Add iOS platform
npm install @capacitor/ios
npx cap add ios

# Add Android platform  
npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
```

**Step 4: Add Native Plugins**
```bash
# Add geolocation plugin for native GPS access
npm install @capacitor/geolocation
```

**Step 5: Configure Native Permissions**
- **iOS**: Added location permissions to `Info.plist`
- **Android**: Added location permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`

**Step 6: Update Code for Cross-Platform**
- Modified location service to use Capacitor's Geolocation plugin
- Added platform detection using `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`
- Implemented fallback strategies for web vs native environments

### The Result: One Codebase, Three Platforms

After Capacitor integration, the same React codebase now runs as:
- **Web App**: Progressive Web App with service worker
- **iOS App**: Native iOS application with App Store distribution
- **Android App**: Native Android application with Google Play distribution

## 🚀 Capacitor: The Cross-Platform Engine

- **Write Once, Run Everywhere**: Single React/TypeScript codebase runs on iOS, Android, and web
- **Native Performance**: Apps run with native performance on mobile devices
- **Native API Access**: Direct access to device features like GPS, camera, and sensors
- **Progressive Web App**: Automatic PWA capabilities with service workers
- **Native UI**: Uses native navigation and UI components on each platform

### Why Capacitor?

Unlike traditional hybrid frameworks, Capacitor:
- Uses modern web APIs and standards
- Provides a native shell that hosts your web app
- Offers seamless integration with native iOS and Android projects
- Supports live reload during development
- Enables easy deployment to app stores

## 📱 Platform Support

### Web Browser (PWA)
- Runs in any modern web browser
- Installable as a Progressive Web App
- Uses Web Geolocation API for location services
- Service worker for offline capabilities

### iOS Native App
- Native iOS application built with Xcode
- Uses Core Location for precise GPS positioning
- Follows iOS design guidelines and navigation patterns
- Deployable to the App Store

### Android Native App
- Native Android application built with Android Studio
- Integrates with Android location services
- Material Design components and animations
- Deployable to Google Play Store

## 🛠️ Capacitor Configuration

The app is configured through `capacitor.config.ts`:

```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.example.app',
  appName: 'WeatherCast',
  webDir: 'dist',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https'
  },
  plugins: {
    Geolocation: {
      permissions: ['location']
    }
  }
};
```

### Key Capacitor Plugins Used

- **@capacitor/geolocation**: Native GPS and location services
